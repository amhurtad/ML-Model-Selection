# ML-Model-Selection
I assessed the performance of three different machine learning models: Decision trees, Logistic Regression and K Nearest Neighbors on 4 datasets to see which one performed best in binary classification. Hyper parameters were tuned and optimized using GridSearch.

The four datasets were taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
